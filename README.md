# GO-HTMX-TODOAPP

This is a simple todo app built with Go and HTMX.

## About The Project

I've been enjoying studing Go, and I wanted to build a simple app to practice. I've also been interested in HTMX, so I decided to use it to build a simple todo app.
The goal of this project is to build a "decent" looking interactive UI using htmx and having it persist data using Go into some sort of database.

I might add more features to this app in the future as I learn more things and need a place to put it to practice, but for now, I'm just focusing on the basics.
